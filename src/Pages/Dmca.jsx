      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether the use
        could be considered fair use. Fair use states that brief excerpts of
        copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted
        verbatim for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and
        research, without the need for permission from or payment to the
        copyright holder.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are
        reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney
        before filing a notification with us.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The DMCA requires you to provide your personal information in the
        copyright infringement notification. If you are concerned about the
        privacy of your personal information, you may wish to{" "}

      <p className="mb-4">
        Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process.
        Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and
        completeness. Our response may include the removal or restriction of
        access to allegedly infringing material.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in
        response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good
        faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning
        the removal or restriction of access.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability to
        pursue any other remedies we may have to address suspected infringement.
